# Designing UX for AI Applications

## Introduction

User experience is how a user interacts with and uses a specific product or service be it a system, tool, or design. When developing AI applications, developers not only focus on ensuring the user experience is effective but also ethical. In this lesson, we cover how to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications that address user needs.

The lesson will cover the following areas:

- Introduction to User Experience and Understanding User Needs
- Designing AI Applications for Trust and Transparency
- Designing AI Applications for Collaboration and Feedback

## Learning goals

After taking this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Understand how to build AI applications that meet the user needs.
- Design AI applications that promote trust and collaboration.

## Introduction to User Experience and Understanding User Needs

In our fictitious education startup, we have two primary users, teachers and students. Each of the two users has unique needs. A user-centered design prioritizes the user ensuring the products are relevant and beneficial for those it is intended for.

The application should be **useful, reliable, accessible and pleasant** to provide a good user experience.

### Usability

Being useful means that the application has functionality that matches its intended purpose, such as automating the grading process or generating flashcards for revision. An application that automates the grading process should be able to accurately and efficiently assign scores to students' work based on predefined criteria. Similarly, an application that generates revision flashcards should be able to create relevant and diverse questions based on its data.

### Reliability

Being reliable means that the application can perform its task consistently and without errors. However, AI just like humans is not perfect and may be prone to errors. The applications may encounter errors or unexpected situations that require human intervention or correction. How do you handle errors? In the last section of this lesson, we will cover how AI systems and applications are designed for collaboration and feedback.

### Accessibility

Being accessible means extending the user experience to users with various abilities, including those with disabilities, ensuring no one is left out. By following accessibility guidelines and principles, AI solutions become more inclusive, usable, and beneficial for all users.

### Pleasant

Being pleasant means that the application is enjoyable to use. An appealing user experience can have a positive impact on the user encouraging them to return to the application and increasing business revenue.

Not every challenge can be solved with AI. AI comes in to augment your user experience, be it automating manual tasks, or personalizing user experiences.
